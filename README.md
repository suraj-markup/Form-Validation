# 1. Form-Validation
This is a normal form validation page. I have used Regex to check the email verification and also used javascript to check other validation rather than using the in-built validation of HTML. Do, checkout this and also review my project.

This was the 2nd mini project my learning series i.e. 'Learning Js with Projects.' 

Parallel to this series I'm going to start the series of 100 days of css. So, in coming future you will be able to see many mini projects coming.
